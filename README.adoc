= SK8S Function Sidecar

Go implementation of https://github.com/markfisher/sk8s/tree/master/function-sidecar

== Building
```
cd $GOPATH
git clone https://github.com/ericbottard/sk8s-function-sidecar src/github.com/sk8sio/function-sidecar
cd src/github.com/sk8sio/function-sidecar
make dockerize
```

== Integration Test
Assuming kafka is running locally on port 9092,
```
GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH) KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092 go test -v cmd/function-sidecar_test.go
```

When running the above integration test with an available Zipkin server, can optionally pass
a configuration setting allowing trace collection:
```
SIDECAR_CONFIG='{"sc.trace.zipkin.url":"http://<zipkin-host>:<zipkin-port>"}'
```
